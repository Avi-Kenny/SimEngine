CCS supercomputer consists number nodes, may multiple cores. typical workflow, user starts logging CCS (via SSH) transferring files CCS filesystem (using Linux commands FTP client). user runs programs submitting “jobs” CCS using special program called job scheduler. job scheduler manages process running jobs parallel across multiple nodes /multiple cores. Although multiple ways run code parallel CCS, SimEngine makes use job arrays. main cluster parallelization function SimEngine run_on_cluster(). Throughout example, use Slurm example job scheduler, analogous workflow apply job scheduling software. illustrate cluster parallelization workflow, consider following simulation: run code CCS, simply wrap run_on_cluster() function. use function, must break code three blocks, called first, main, last. code first block run , set simulation object. finished, SimEngine save simulation object filesystem CCS. code main block run simulation replicate, access simulation object created first block. cases, code main block simply include single call run(). Finally, code last block run simulation replicates finished running, SimEngine automatically compiled results simulation object. Use run_on_cluster() function illustrated : Note none actual simulation code changed (exception specifying n_cores=20 set_config() call); simply divided code chunks placed chunks appropriate block (first, main, last) within run_on_cluster().
