# Overview

```{r}

library(magrittr) # !!!!! Finish NAMESSPACES chapter and get rid of this
library(parallel) # !!!!! Finish NAMESSPACES chapter and get rid of this

# !!!!! Add list levels (see z.stepped.wedge)

# The notion of "simulation constants" is more of an organizational convenience
#   than anything else. As one might guess, a simulation constant is something 
#   that does not change across your entire set of simulations. You could just
#    as easily hard-code values in your code, but it's often easier to have
#    these declared at a separate section so that they can be easily modified if
#    needed.
sim %<>% add_constants(
  "lambda2" = 4, # !!!!! testing
  "lambda3" = 6 # !!!!! testing
)

# !!!!! Links to all functions in docs

sim %<>% add_script(
  "my script",
  function(L,C) { # !!!!! Consider not making this a function of L and just relying on this being run in a specific environment
    
    data <- create_poisson_data(L$sample_size, L$lambda)

    lambda_hat <- use_method(L$estimators, data)
    # !!!!! Replace "use_method" with `call` or `do.call` ?????
    
    time <- Sys.time()
    
    # `results` should be a list of key-value pairs
    # !!!!! Throw warning if any column names are duplicated/overwritten
    return (list(
      "lambda_hat" = lambda_hat,
      "time" = time
    ))

  }
)

# Print simulation object
print(sim)

# !!!!! Copy everything in from z_stepped_wedge and z_572_paper

# Run only simulations with UIDs 3,6
sim %<>% run("my script", sim_uids=c(3,6))

# Summarize results (with standard deviations)
# !!!!! Throw warning if any column names are duplicated/overwritten
# Make it such that you can't use expressions like `truth=C$lambda` here (i.e. 
#     you can't pass constants); instead, add constants to results data frame
#     and reference by quotes like the others; alternatively
summary(
  sim,
  sd = list(name="sd_lambda", x="lambda_hat"),
  bias = list(name="bias_lambda", truth="lambda", estimate="lambda_hat")
)

# !!!!! Coverage; see z.stepped_wedge
# !!!!! Error handling

```


# Using previously-defined functions

Above, we created new functions and named them "create_rct" and "OLS". It's also easy to use previously-defined functions. You can give the functions a new name, or use the name of the function.

```{r}

create_data <- function(n, sigma) {
  x <- runif(n)
  y <- 4*x + rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=sigma)
  return (data.frame(x=x,y=y))
}

ols <-   function(data) {
  model <- lm(y~x, data=data)
  return (model$coefficients[["x"]])
}

sim %<>% add_creator(create_data)
sim %<>% add_method(ols)

```
